## The element of style. 

> recommended by Leon

### Cha 2 Elementary rules of usage

#### Enclose parenthetic(插句) expressions between commas

If the interruption to the flow of the sentence is but **slight**, the writer may safely omit the commas.

但是前后两个逗号要么全不用要么全用。

+ a tension exists between X and X.
+ to a less extent:. Placement is an important stage in the VLSI design flow, because it affects routability, performance, heat distribution, and **to a less extent**, power consumption of a design.

#### Place a comma before and or but introducing an independent clause

+ 两个独立句子中间不能加逗号。
+ 要加逗号的话必须接 as,for,or,nor... (同理，两个句子被这些词语分隔的话，必须有逗号)

#### A participial phrase（分词短语） at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject

> Walking slowly down the road, he saw a woman accompanied by two children.

The word walking refers to the subject of the sentence, not to the woman. If the writer wishes to make it refer to the woman, he must recast the sentence:

> He saw a woman, accompanied by two children, walking slowly down the road.

此时，walking slowly的人就是woman了

连词或介词前的短语，并列名词，形容词和形容词短语 如果在句子开头也遵循相同的规则。

### Char 3 Elementary principles of composition

#### As a rule, begin each paragraph with a topic sentence; end it in conformity with the beginning

#### 尽量使用active voice

+ avoid making one passive depend directly upon another.

  > Gold was not allowed to be exported. （allow 和export 两个被动）

+ 表被动的名词 不能 继续用于被动句

  > A survey of this region was made in 1900. (被调查的region)

#### Omit needless words

> he is a man who -> he

尤其注意 the fact that。

> owing to the fact that -> because

Who is, which was

> Trafalgar, which was Nelson’s last battle -> Trafalgar, Nelson’s last battle

#### Avoid a succession of loose sentences （避免出现一连串松散的话）

#### Express co-ordinate ideas in similar form 

如果是相似的内容，最好用相似的格式

#### Keep related words together

> Wordsworth, in the fifth book of The Excursion, gives a minute description of this church.
>
> ->
>
> In the fifth book of The Excursion, Wordsworth gives a minute description of this church.

修饰词最好放在被修饰的词旁边

> He only found two mistakes ->  He found only two mistakes.

#### 把想强调的词放在最后面

### Char 4 A few matters a form

+ **certainaly** 是个语气很终的词

+ 括号
  + 不是完整句子
    + 逗号放外面
    + 感叹号问号放里面
  + 是完整句子
    + 放里面

### Char 5 Words and expressions commonly misused

+ **As good or better than**

  > My opinion is as good or better than his -> My opinion is as good as his, or better

+ **case** is unnecessary in some cases (= =)

  > In many cases, the rooms were poorly ventilated -> Many of the rooms were poorly ventilated.

+ **certainly** 是个语气比较重的词。不要频繁不加分别的使用

+ **claim** 不能作为 declare, maintain charge 的替代品

+ **compare to & compare with** 龟龟 一直不知道的东西

  + compare to: 有本质不同的两物指出相似性
  + compare with: 本质相同的两物指出不同 (帮助记忆：相同的人才可能with, you with me)

+ **Clever** 被滥用了，最好只用在 **小事上的独创性**

+ **Etc.** 只能用于整个list已经完整的出现过了。

  + 不能用于人名
  + 不能用在such as, for example, or any...
  + 正式文章最好也不用

+ **fact** 可以验证（verification）的事项上用这个词，如果是判断（judgement）就不能用

+ **factor** 这个词很多时候可以换一种更直接的方式表示出来。

  > Heavy artillery is becoming an increasingly important factor in deciding battles.
  >
  > ->
  >
  > Heavy artillery is playing a larger and larger part in deciding battles.

+ **Feature** 和factor一样

+ **He is a man who** 冗余!

+ **However**, 如果表示**然而**时，不应放在要接句子的开头。（放在开头表示 in whatever way, whatever extent)

  > The roads were almost impassable. **However**, we at last succeeded in reaching camp.
  >
  > ->
  >
  > The roads were almost impassable. At last, **however**, we succeeded in reaching camp.

+ 尽量不要在文章开头 用 **one of the most**， 太狂了

+ **people** 是一个政治性的词汇，很多时候我们可以用 **the public**

+ 尽量少用 **while**
